# KLayout-PCell-Waveguide
Open-source learning project for Python scripts to create KLayout PCells for silicon waveguides using SiEPIC-Tools. Initiated by Subhash Arya, North-Eastern Hill University (NEHU).
KLayout-PCell-Waveguide
Welcome to the KLayout-PCell-Waveguide project! This open-source learning project develops Python scripts for creating Parameterized Cells (PCells) in KLayout to design silicon waveguides for photonic integrated circuits. It builds on SiEPIC-Tools and SiEPIC EBeam PDK, with full credit to the SiEPIC team.
Project Purpose
This project aims to:

Create reusable, parameterized waveguide components for silicon photonics.
Serve as a learning platform for Python, KLayoutâ€™s PCell API, and SiEPIC utilities.
Foster open-source collaboration in the photonics community.

Note: This is a community-driven project initiated by Subhash C Arya, affiliated with North-Eastern Hill University (NEHU), and is not an official initiative of NEHU, SiEPIC, or SiEPICfab.
Getting Started

Install KLayout: Download from klayout.de.
Install SiEPIC-Tools and EBeam PDK:
Follow SiEPIC EBeam PDK instructions.
Install SiEPIC-Tools via KLayoutâ€™s Package Manager or SiEPIC/SiEPIC-Tools.


Clone this Repository:git clone https://github.com/aryasubh/KLayout-PCell-Waveguide.git


Set Up Python Environment: Ensure Python 3.x is installed with dependencies (e.g., numpy, pya for KLayout).
Explore the Code: Check the scripts/ folder for Python scripts and examples.
